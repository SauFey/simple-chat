# Code of Conduct 🌈

## Our Pledge

We are committed to creating a welcoming, inclusive, and safe environment for everyone who participates in this project — especially since this community is built with LGBTQ+ users in mind.

We welcome people of all backgrounds and identities, including (but not limited to):
sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, race, ethnicity, disability, age, body type, religion, and level of experience.

This project is not “neutral territory” — it is intentionally built to be respectful, kind, and safe.

### ❌ Examples of unacceptable behavior

- Hate speech, discrimination, or demeaning language
- Harassment, bullying, threats, or intimidation

## Safety First (Community Goal)

Because this project aims to support a real community, we take the following especially seriously:

- Racism, homophobia, transphobia, misogyny, and ableism are not tolerated
- Misgendering or mocking someone’s identity is not tolerated
- Encouraging self-harm or targeting vulnerable people is not tolerated

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying standards and taking appropriate action in response to any unacceptable behavior.

Maintainers may remove, edit, or reject contributions and may temporarily or permanently ban users from participation when required.

---

## Reporting

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, please report it.

**Contact:**

- Create an issue labeled `conduct` (if safe to do so), or
- Email the maintainer directly: **(add email here)**

All reports will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Maintainers will follow these general steps when responding to incidents:

1. **Warning** – A private warning explaining the issue
2. **Temporary ban** – Temporary restriction from contributions or participation
3. **Permanent ban** – Removal from the community if repeated or severe violations occur

Severe incidents may skip directly to a ban.

## Scope
